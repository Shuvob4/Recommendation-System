    "\n",
    "Recommendation Systems (RS) are responsible for suggesting movies, book, products, news, songs, people and so on to new or current users for better customer experience and increasing sell and profit for the company. But to do so, these system needs a huge amount of previous data of users, products which is available via previous purchase or interaction which already happened in the platform. Today RS is being used in many domains like - e-commerce, entertainment, social, academic and so on. The way data are collected in real word and the way they are being fitted in the recommendation system, the approach of recommending can be classified as:\n",
    "* Content-Based (CB), \n",

    "* Hybrid \n",
    "Before these kind of RS, there was also anothere one which is basically hand picked recommendation products or items we used to see in restaurant or local coffe shops or local book store which displayed as **'Most Popular Items'**, it's a rank based recommendation system, which do not use any algorithm like the ones which are used in industry.\n",

    "## Content-Based Filtering \n",
    "Content-based filtering is a technique used in recommendation systems that analyzes the characteristics or properties of an item to recommend similar items to users. In content-based filtering, the system learns from the attributes of the items that the user has previously interacted with, and then recommends items with similar attributes. Content based filtering can be classified as Classifier-based and Neighbourhood-based. Both method used user interaction data and difference is how they use the data in each method. For Classifier-based method, the system learns a classifier model from the features of items that users have interacted with in the past. The model is then used to predict the likelihood that a user will interact with a new item, based on its features. While, In neighborhood-based approach, the system identifies a set of items that are similar to the items that the user has interacted with in the past. The system then recommends items from this set to the user. advantage of classifier-based content-based filtering is that it can handle more complex item features than simple similarity metrics. It also has the potential to handle new items with no prior user interactions, as long as the item features are well defined.\n",

    "## Collaborative Filtering \n",
    "\n",
    "Collaborative filtering is a technique used in recommendation systems that analyzes the past behavior or preferences of a group of users to recommend items to individual users. In collaborative filtering, the system learns from the behavior of other users with similar preferences to generate recommendations for a target user.  It does not need to analyze the content of the items. Instead, it relies on the relationship between users and items, which are typically encoded in a rating feedback matrix with each element representing a specific user rating on a specific item. Collaborative filtering is based on the assumption that users with similar tastes for previous items will have similar preferences for new items, so the algorithm recommends items ranked highly by users deemed similar to the current user. Such algorithms fall into two main categories, Neighbourhood-based and Model-based. \n",
    "\n",
    "Neighborhood-based collaborative filtering is a popular approach to collaborative filtering that identifies a set of similar users to a target user, and then generates recommendations based on the behavior of those similar users.\n",
    "\n",
    "Model-based collaborative filtering is an approach to collaborative filtering that uses machine learning algorithms to learn the underlying patterns and relationships in the user-item matrix, and then generates recommendations based on those patterns and relationships.\n",

    "* Can be computationally expensive as it requires training and optimizing machine learning algorithms on a large user-item matrix. \n",
    "*  Suffer from the **'overfitting'** problem, where the model becomes too complex and fits too closely to the training data, leading to poor generalization to new users and items.\n",
    "* Suffer from the **'sparsity'** problem, where the user-item matrix has a large number of empty entries, making it difficult to identify similar users.\n",
    "* Suffer from the **'gray sheep'** problem, where some users have unique preferences that do not match well with any other users, making it difficult to find similar users. \n",
    "* Requires a significant amount of data to train the machine learning algorithms effectively.\n",

    "## Generic Problem Faced in Recommendation Systems\n",
    "### Cold Start Problem\n",
    "The cold start problem is a challenge that arises in recommendation systems when there is not enough data available to make accurate recommendations for new users or new items that have just been added to the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "For new users, the system does not have enough historical data on their interactions with the system, such as their ratings, purchases, or clicks, to understand their preferences and make relevant recommendations. For new items, the system does not have enough information about the item's characteristics, such as its genre, director, or actors, to recommend it to users who might be interested in it.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several ways to address this issue in RS, such as\n",
    "* **Content-based filtering**\n",
    "* **Knowledge-based recommendations**\n",
    "* **Hybrid filtering**\n",
    "* **Feature Combination**\n",
    "* **Feature Augmentation**\n",
    "* **Active learning**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sparsity Problem\n",
    "The sparsity problem is a common challenge in recommendation systems that arises when the available data on user-item interactions is very sparse, i.e., there are very few ratings or interactions between users and items. Sparsity can make it difficult for recommendation algorithms to accurately capture the preferences of users and make relevant recommendations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sparsity is a problem for many recommendation algorithms, but it is particularly challenging for collaborative filtering, which relies on the similarity between users or items to make recommendations. When the data is very sparse, it becomes difficult to compute accurate similarity measures, and the recommendations may be biased or unreliable.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several ways to address the sparsity problem in recommendation systems, including:\n",
    "* **Data augmentation**\n",
    "* **Regularization**\n",
    "* **Matrix factorization**\n",
    "* **Neighborhood-based methods**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data quality and quantity problem\n",
    "Data quality and quantity are critical factors in building effective recommendation systems. The quality of the data used to train the recommendation system directly impacts the accuracy and relevance of the recommendations provided. The following are some of the problems related to data quality and quantity in recommendation systems:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Data Bias**\n",
    "* **Incomplete Data**\n",
    "* **Noise**\n",
    "\n",
    "To overcome these challenges, data pre-processing techniques such as data cleaning, feature engineering, and normalization can be employed to improve data quality. Also, data augmentation techniques such as incorporating social network data, item descriptions, or user demographics can be employed to address data sparsity and improve the quantity of data available.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scalability Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Scalability is a critical challenge in building recommendation systems, particularly as the amount of data and the number of users and items increase. A recommendation system that works well with a small dataset may not be scalable to a larger dataset, which can make it challenging to provide real-time or near-real-time recommendations. The following are some of the scalability problems in recommendation systems:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Computation time**\n",
    "* **Memory Limitations**\n",
    "* **Distributed data**\n",
    "\n",
    "To address scalability challenges, recommendation systems can employ various techniques such as:\n",
    "* **Parallel computing**\n",
    "* **Sampling techniques**\n",
    "* **Distributed computing**\n",
    "\n",

In other words it does not address cold start problem and in real life scenario data is highly sparsed.\n",

    "To introduce cold start problem as well as to work with sparse matrix, we have used collaborative filtering as it is also used in the industry. We implemented model based collaborative filtering to introduce cold start problem and how to deal with it, user based collaborative filtering & item based collaborative filtering for working with sparse martix which resembles the real world scenario.\n",

    "We have only tried collaborative filtering to introduce two of the most common challenges face while developing Recommendation system. We did not tried content based fitering as our description does not contain much information whcih can be used as feature while building content based filtering. With other dataset, it might be good to use the content based filtering as there will be more features that can be fed into the model to generate recommendation. Also we did not use, deep learning methods as well as hybrid method due to the lack of our computanional capability of our machines. With high configurable computer, it would be best to apply those methods."
